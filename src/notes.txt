1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

The purpose of this project is to develop a program for implementing autocomplete functionality.
Autocomplete is a widely used feature in many applications, and it predicts and displays query suggestions to users as they type.
In this assignment, I am tasked with creating an immutable data type called "Term," which represents autocomplete terms.
Each term comprises a string query and a real-valued weight. The critical aspect of this data type is that it supports three different comparison orders:
lexicographic order of the query, descending order by weight, and lexicographic order of the query but limited to the first 'r' characters.
These comparisons are crucial for efficiently retrieving and sorting autocomplete suggestions.

The primary objective is to ensure that when a user enters a prefix, I can quickly find and present a list of matching queries, sorted by their weights in descending order. This project is essential in applications like search engines, databases, and text input on mobile devices, where providing timely and relevant autocomplete suggestions greatly enhances the user experience.
